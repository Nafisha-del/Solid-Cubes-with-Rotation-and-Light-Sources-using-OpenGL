# Solid Cubes with Rotation and Light Sources using OpenGL

Using OpenGL to create multiple cubes with textured images. The cubes have rotations along with multiple light sources.
In this project, a 3D graphic, i.e. a solid color cube has been rendered. The 
rendered cube shows only one color (red) through the use of textures in OpenGL. The cube has 
been rendered using OpenGL library functions. Multiple 3D transformations such as translation, 
rotation, and scaling has been applied along with adding extra features such as light source, mouse 
movement, keyboard use, etc.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run the Project1.sln on Visual Studio.

The required dependencies are required to be checked along with the directories of the files.


## Features

The project features implemented for the solid color cube using OpenGL is briefly 
described in the following:
1. The screen size/window size is 1920x1080 pixels.
2. Use of multiple light sources.
3. Rendering ten cubes from single cube vertex array.
4. Rotating the cubes towards x-, y-, and z-axis according to the positions of the cubes.
5. Rotating, translating, and scaling light cubes. 
6. Processing keyboard to detect up (W), down (S), left (A), and right (D) keys.
7. Detecting and processing mouse movement to scroll accordingly. 
8. Loading 2D textures from images.
9. Showing perspective projection.
10. Applying basic lightings such as diffuse, ambient, and specular.
11. Applying materials properties (diffuse for red color image and specular for 3x3 grid).
12. Applying point light (for the light cubes) and spotlight.
